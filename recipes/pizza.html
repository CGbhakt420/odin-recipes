    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Neapolitan pizza, or pizza Napoletana, is a type of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. This style of pizza
        is prepared with simple and fresh ingredients: a basic dough, raw tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh
        basil, and olive oil. No fancy toppings are allowed! </p>
    <p>One of its defining characteristics is that there is often more sauce than cheese. This leaves the middle of the
        pie wet or soggy and not conducive to being served by the slice. Because of this, Neapolitan pizzas are
        generally pretty small (about 10 to 12 inches), making them closer to the size of a personal pizza. </p>
    <p>Neapolitan pizzas are also cooked at very high temperatures (800 F to 900 F) for no more than 90 seconds. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For Dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups Italian tipo "00" flour, or bread flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>Cooking spray, or olive oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>For Sauce & Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled Italian tomatoes, preferably San Marzano</li>
        <li>12 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch slices or torn into small chunks</li>
        <li>2 ounces fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps To Make It</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix to
            combine</li>
        <li>Add the water and mix to combine</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on low speed for 10 minutes. The mixture should come together into a unified mass that
            barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. If the dough is sticking, add more flour, 1 tablespoon
            at a time, to the mixer while it is running, until the mass barely sticks to the bowl. If the mixture is too
            dry, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the running mixer. </li>
        <li>Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 72 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to make the pizza, transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Divide the pizza dough into 4
            even sections.</li>
        <li>Coat 4 small containers or bowls with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil.</li>
        <li>With floured hands, form each section into a ball.</li>
        <li>Place 1 dough ball into each coated container or bowl. Lightly spray the top of each dough ball with
            nonstick cooking spray or coat with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cover each container or bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Each
            dough ball should double in volume.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce by either pushing the tomatoes through a food mill or simply pulsing them in a food processor
            until a chunky liquid is formed. </li>
        <li>Heat the oven to at least 475 F, higher if your oven allows. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to
            heat as well. </li>
        <li>Onto a well-floured surface, stretch out each ball of dough into a 10-inch circle. Use a floured rolling pin
            if you need to. Dont worry about the dough being a perfect circle.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a pizza peel making sure to cover where the dough will sit. Place one rolled-out piece of
            dough onto the peel and shake gently to ensure that the dough is not sticking. </li>
        <li>Spread about 1/3 cup of sauce over the dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch of the edge bare.</li>
        <li>Top the sauce with 1/4 of the mozzarella slices. Tear a few basil leaves and place them on top (according to
            your liking), and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. You can also add the basil and olive oil after
            the pizza is cooked.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza from the peel to the hot stone by gently shaking the peel back and forth until the pizza
            slides completely onto the stone.</li>
        <li>Bake about 5 to 7 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is charred in places.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining dough balls and ingredients.</li>
        <li>Enjoy. </li>
    </ol>
