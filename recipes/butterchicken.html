    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in Delhi. It is a type of
        curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is
        similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
